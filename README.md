A Hearthstone ai implementation for the [fireplace simulator](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace/).
Uses self-play to train and MCTS + NN for decision making.
Based off the alphazero algorithm (and its implementation [here](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general)), and a [similar project](https://github.com/peter1591/hearthstone-ai) by @peter1591.

### A work in progress
